### we need to install libpcap-dev or else we will end up with the following errors:
### Error loading shared library libpcap.so.1: No such file or directory (needed by /usr/bin/packet-capture)
### Error relocating /usr/bin/packet-capture: pcap_set_tstamp_type: symbol not found\

### We can avoid to run as root by explicitly setting the CAP_NET_RAW capability to the sniffer binary.
### This capability is usually allowed by default by the container runtime but it can be explicitely
### provided using --cap-add NET_RAW (Docker) at runtime
